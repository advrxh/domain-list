# domain-list
This is a list of domain names belonging to big organizations, such as **Google**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **GitHub** and co.

## How can I contribute?
### If the company already exists
Just add the domain names you know to the existing company file (```[company]/[company].json```).
### If the company does not already exist
Create a folder with the name of the company. Inside this folder, create a file named ```[company].json``` where company should be the company's name.

After that, just create a pull request to this repository. If everything is correct, I will try to merge your branch as fast as possible.
### Trademarks
This is very important due to legal reasons: Please add a trademark/ copyright notice at the bottom of this README (in the corresponding section) containing a small trademark notice. You can copy-paste the example trademark notice and fill it with "your" company's data. Thanks a lot!

## How can I find out domain names?
One possible option may be reloading/ loading the company's main website and then looking into your browser's inspector's network tab which domains the website is "calling". 

Another option could be looking on the website if there are just some basic links to "project" websites of the company.
